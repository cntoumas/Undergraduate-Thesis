# Undergraduate-Thesis
This repo contains my undergraduate Thesis named: **Design and simulation of digital image processing modules using Verilog HDL**.
The kernels used for the processing were a simple **Box blur** and a **Sobel edge detector**. 
The whole architecture was designed using **pipeline** techniques to improve throughput and the results were validated through MATLAB.
